The author has come up with some tips that will help keep your nails clean and healthy.

Let’s see one by one how to take care of nails naturally.

1. **Keep Your Feet Clean And Dry:** Start making the habit of washing your feet with warm water and soap while showering. Thoroughly wash your toenails and dry them by using a cotton towel. Any moisture may lead to the development of infection
2. **Keep Your Nails Thin:** You can clean your nails at home or with a [pedicurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicure), but try to clean and disinfect files to prevent fungus.
3. **Wear Lightweight And Breathable Socks:** To support healthy nails, you must select a good pair of lightweight pure cotton socks.
4. **Avoid Home Made Remedies:** Home remedies like apple cider or tea tree oil can help to a small extent, but to cure for the long term, we should address theroot cause of nail problems. This root cause is internal, and I found out that these so-called remedies sometimes make it worse.
5. **Don’t Walk Barefoot:** to avoid direct contact with bacteria, try to use socks or slippers. Especially at public places such as pools, gyms, etc, you must be careful to walk barefoot.
